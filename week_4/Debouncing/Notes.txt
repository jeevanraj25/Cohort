The onInput() Function
The onInput function is an event handler in JavaScript that gets executed when the value of an input field is changed by the user. This event is triggered dynamically as the user types or modifies the content within the input field. The onInput event is commonly used to perform actions in real-time as the user interacts with the input element.
 
Understanding Debouncing 
Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, making them more efficient. In the context of onInput events, debouncing is often applied to delay the execution of certain actions (e.g., sending requests) until after a user has stopped typing for a specific duration.
 
Implementation:
The following example demonstrates debouncing in the onInput event to delay the execution of a function that sends a request based on user input.


<html>
  <body>
    <!-- Input field with onInput event and debouncing -->
    <input id="textInput" type="text" onInput="debounce(handleInput, 500)" placeholder="Type something...">

    <!-- Display area for the debounced input value -->
    <p id="displayText"></p>

    <script>
      // Debounce function to delay the execution of a function
      function debounce(func, delay) {
        let timeoutId;

        return function() {
          // Clear the previous timeout
          clearTimeout(timeoutId);

          // Set a new timeout
          timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
            func.apply(this, arguments);
          }, delay);
        };
      }

      // Function to handle the debounced onInput event
      function handleInput() {
        // Get the input field's value
        const inputValue = document.getElementById("textInput").value;

        // Display the input value in the paragraph
        document.getElementById("displayText").innerText = "You typed: " + inputValue;

        // Simulate sending a request (replace with actual AJAX call)
        console.log("Request sent:", inputValue);
      }
    </script>
  </body>

Explanation:
The debounce function is a generic debounce implementation that takes a function (func) and a delay time (delay).
Inside the debounce function, a timeout is set to delay the execution of the provided function (func) by the specified delay time (delay).
The handleInput function is the actual function to be executed when the onInput event occurs. It simulates sending a request (e.g., an AJAX call) based on user input.
How it works:
When a user types in the input field, the onInput event triggers the debounce function.
The debounce function sets a timeout, and if the user continues typing within the specified delay time, the previous timeout is cleared, and a new one is set.
After the user stops typing for the specified delay, the handleInput function is executed.
 
This ensures that the function associated with the onInput event is not called on every keystroke but rather after the user has stopped typing for a brief moment, reducing unnecessary and potentially resource-intensive calls, such as sending requests.
 
Throttling vs Rate Limiting
Throttling:
Definition: Controls the rate at which a specific action is performed.
Purpose: Ensures a smooth user experience, preventing rapid consecutive actions.
Implementation: Limits the frequency of a particular function within a specified time frame.
Rate Limiting:
Definition: Controls the number of requests a client can make within a specific time period.
Purpose: Protects server resources, avoids abuse, and maintains fair usage.
Implementation: Typically applied at the server/API level, limiting requests per second or minute.
Key Differences:
Throttling focuses on action frequency; rate limiting focuses on request count.
Throttling can be applied to various actions; rate limiting is often used at the API level.
Throttling aims for a smooth user experience; rate limiting protects server resources and enforces fairness.
